This repository is the official implementation of FSTINet, a novel framework designed for class-agnostic motion prediction in autonomous driving scenarios. FSTINet addresses key challenges in spatio-temporal dependency modeling and dynamic feature capture by integrating spatial-temporal dynamics with frequency-domain information, as proposed in the paper:FSTINet: Spatial-Temporal Integrated Network for Class-Agnostic Motion Prediction with Frequency-Spatial Fusion(Paper File: FSTINet___Yuzhuo_Feng___2025 (1).pdf | Code will be released soon)
